# Music Player Web App

This web app is a simple music player built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It offers the following features:

1. **Play and Pause**: Click the middle button or press the space key on your keyboard to play or pause the current song.
2. **Song Navigation**: Use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to switch between songs.
3. **Back Button**: Located in the top left corner, it takes you back to the main menu with a play button.
4. **Song List**: The top right button displays all available songs. You can select a song to play.
5. **Search Functionality**: On the song list page, use the search field to find specific songs. If a song exists, it updates the list; otherwise, it displays a "song not found" message. You can also press "Enter" to search.
